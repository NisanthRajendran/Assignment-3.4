1.Importance of name node in hadoop cluster
       *It is the master.It stores the metadata of HDFS which consists of location and the amount of data in data nodes.It has more RAM.
       *When namenode is not working,HDFS is inaccessible.
       *It doesn't store the actual data or dataset.This  is done by datanodes.
       *It is a single point of failure
       *Clients contact with the name node to locate a file whether to add or delete it.
       *It maps the blocks to datanodes.
       
       
 2. Practice the beginners commands for HDFS from the below link
     a) Creation of a directory
     b) Contents in the directory is displayed
     c) put command -copied the file Sample.txt to HDFS
     d) get command - copied the file from HDFS to local system
     e) checking utility - Run a DFS Filesystem to Check Utility
     f) Directory Space - Check Directory Space in HDFS
     g) ls command - The ‘list’ command displays all the available files inside a particular path.
     h) hadoop balancer - The command ‘balancer’ will check for work load on nodes in cluster and balance it.
     i) HELP - The ‘help’ command is for asking for help or querying a particular question.
     j) Removing file from HDFS - The command ‘rm’ will delete the file stored inside the HDFS.
       NOTE : The screenshot 'a' displays the creation of directory
              The screenshot 'b' displays the contents in directory and so on
